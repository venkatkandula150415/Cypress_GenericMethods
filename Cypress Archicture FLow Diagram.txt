Cypress is a popular end-to-end testing framework for web applications. Its architecture and flow diagram can be summarized as follows:

	1.	Test Runner:
	•	The Cypress Test Runner is where you write, debug, and run your tests.
	•	It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for test execution.
	2.	Cypress CLI:
	•	The Cypress Command Line Interface (CLI) is used to manage test execution, run tests in headless mode, and integrate with Continuous Integration (CI) systems.
	3.	Test Files:
	•	Test files in Cypress are written in JavaScript using Mocha or another test framework like Jasmine.
	•	These files contain test cases and assertions to validate the behavior of your web application.
	4.	Cypress APIs:
	•	Cypress provides a rich set of APIs for interacting with your application under test (AUT) and performing various actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and verifying elements.
	5.	Browser Automation:
	•	Cypress uses a special browser (based on Electron) to execute tests and interact with the web application.
	•	This browser is designed specifically for testing purposes and provides features like automatic waiting, time-traveling for debugging, and consistent behavior across different environments.
	6.	Request Handling:
	•	Cypress can intercept and modify network requests and responses, allowing you to simulate different network conditions and test how your application responds.
	7.	Assertions and Reporting:
	•	After running tests, Cypress provides detailed reports with information about test results, including passed and failed assertions, test durations, and any errors encountered during execution.

Here’s a simplified flow diagram of Cypress testing:

This diagram illustrates the flow of writing tests, using Cypress APIs to interact with the application, browser automation for executing tests, handling network requests, and finally generating reports based on test results.
